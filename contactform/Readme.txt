Welcome to Brett LeBaron's portfolio! Thank you for taking a look.

In my portfolio I briefly introduce myself and provide links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, as well as my resume.
In the 'Portfolio' section, I have highlighted several projects I have worked on, and provided links to those projects as well as links to the GitHub repositories for each project.
Lastly, you can find my contact information as well as a contact form which will forward your message to my email address.

I hope you enjoy my portfolio: https://eastwo0d7.github.io/Updated_Profile/index.html
